# Minesweeper
This is an implementation of minesweeper using react.

## Features:
1. 8x8 grid with 10 mines. 
2. Timer keeping track of time elapsed. 
3. *Move counter* and mine counter. 
4. *Validate* button to check board state. 
5. New Game button to create a new game.
6. Cheat Code

This game follows the rules of the Windows 98 version, hence the first move is free. The Cheat code is inspired by this version too (XYZZY + Enter). The user can also play the game by flagging what he/she believes are the mines and then validating the board to see if the flags are placed correctly. 

## Logging

This app logs the board state so it could be used for further analysis down the line. 

## Hosting
